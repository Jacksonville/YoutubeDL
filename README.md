# YoutubeDL
GUI wrapper for the youtube-dl exe (https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/)

I wrote this little nugget to help those who are not comfortable with a commandline. 
Youtube-dl is a fantastic project and is constantly being updated to cater for any changes that happen on Youtube.
Upon startup the app does a quick version check to see if there is a new version and prompts you to update.
I built in a search function that searches for your search term on youtube and scrapes the first response.
Output can be controlled, allowing you to decide between the video or just audio output.

I do not take  responsibility for any users actions. Enjoy
